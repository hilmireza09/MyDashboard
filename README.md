3. **Revenue Insights Dashboard (Power BI)** – Visualizes financial KPIs such as profit, expenses, and budget comparisons.
4. **Market Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)** – Presents competitive market insights and key performance indicators.
5. **Hangry (Looker Studio)** – Presents competitive market insights and key performance indicators.
